# Python Skills Check — Slides 1–60

# ============================================================
# DIRECTIONS
# ============================================================
# - I recommend you create a repo first and clone it.
# - Drag this folder into your repo and then push when you are done.
#
#
# Complete each task underneath its directions.
# 
#
# RULES:
# - Use ONLY concepts we have learned in class.
# - Use the EXACT variable names provided.
# - Do not delete the directions.
# - Your entire Python file must run without errors.
# - Do NOT manually type an answer that Python should calculate.
# - Read carefully. Some questions are intentionally tricky.


# ============================================================
# SECTION 1 — COMMENTS & PRINTING
# ============================================================

# TASK 1:
# Below this comment, write a SINGLE-LINE comment that says:
#
# This is my first comment

# this is my first comment

#
# Python Skills Check
#
# Make sure Python treats the words as text.

# TASK 3:
# Write THREE separate print() statements.
#
# Print:
#
# Your first name
# Your favorite food
# A number between 1 and 100
#
# IMPORTANT:
# The first two should be text.
# The third should be a number.
